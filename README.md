# RGB Color Game

Check it out [here](https://nikantic.github.io/RGBColorGame/)! Have fun! 

This is a fun little project I did as a part of [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/ ).

The goal is to guess the color based on the given RGB value. There is a hard mode with 6 colors, and an easy mode with only 3 colors to guess from. All the colors and values are randomly generated.
